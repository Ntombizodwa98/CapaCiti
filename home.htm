                <h2>The School of Hope!</h2>
				<p>Mzamomtsha is a combined (primary and secondary) school located between Khayelitsha and Umfuleni
				Township in the Western Cape province of the Republic of South Africa.
				Our curiculum is outstanding providing a broad range of <strong>experiences and opportunities to learners through themed topics to apply their literacy, numeracy and ICT skills.</strong><p>
				
				<p>We recognise each child's individual talents, we want pupils at Mzamomtsha to have momorable life
				long learning experiences. We believe our school is very special, we have a learning environment to be proud of,
				and we have amazing teachers and support staff, and as a result pupils are engaged, enthusiastic and proud of their school.
				Year on year the school has achieved high standards of attainment in literacy and numeracy. Learners
				leave the school well above expectations for <em>reading, writing, maths and science.</em>
				We strive continually at the school to provide learning of the highest quality, being a teaching school, we are lucky to provide
				training and support through the affinity teaching school alliance.</p>
